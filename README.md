# Generate-Password
## Description
A password generater application used to create a random password for maximum protection.
- My motivation was to create an application to generate a random password to maximize online security.
- This project was built to strenghen my html and css skills as well as continue enhancing my javascript skillset, especially with arrays, parseInt, and if/for statements.
- This application creates random passwords with an assortment of numbers, random characters and upper and lower case characters to maximize online security.
- I learned how to use methods to create arrays and parseInt.
## Installation
I began by creating a repository on GitHub to use as my server.
I then worked on locally on the html, css and javascript to create an application that creates random passwords based on a given criteria.
